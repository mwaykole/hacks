## Core Concepts

### The Big Insight
**LLM inference = 2 different jobs with different resource needs**
- Prefill: Parallel, compute-heavy, short
- Decode: Sequential, memory-heavy, long
- **Solution:** Disaggregate them!

### The Architecture
**Client → Gateway → Scheduler → Routing Sidecar → vLLM**
- Each component has a specific role
- Scheduler makes it intelligent
- Sidecar orchestrates P/D split
- vLLM does the work

### The Stack
**7 layers from client to model:**
1. Entry (Gateway/Envoy)
2. Routing (Scheduler/EPP)
3. Discovery (InferencePool)
4. Orchestration (Routing Sidecar)
5. Inference (vLLM)
6. Multi-Node (LeaderWorkerSet)
7. Hardware (GPUs)
